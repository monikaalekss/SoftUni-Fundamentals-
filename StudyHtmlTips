<h1><b>Tips and Tricks for studying</b></h1>
<hr>
 <ol>
   <li><b>Choose an environment that will help you to focus on your studies</b>
   <p>What works for your roommate or your best friend, might not work for you.
     If you do your best work in your dorm room, <p>clear your desk off so that only the
     things you need for that subject are in your space. </p>
   <p>I love studying alone in my room without any noises,but <p>
           there are people who love listening to music while studying.
       </p>
   <p><b><yellow>Choose an environment that works for you and if you suddenly need a change of location, go for it!</yellow></b></p>

     <li><b>Clear your mind</b>
     <p>Take a few minutes before you start your study session, or between subjects, to close your eyes and clear your mind of everything else.</p>

     <li><b>Take breaks</b>
     <p> Refusing to take a break while you’re studying is a sure-fire way to feel overloaded and run down during your study session. </p>
     <p>Take a few minutes to eat something, to check your email or just take a quick shower.</p>

     <li><b>Stay hydrated</b>
     <p> Multiple studies have found that drinking water can improve brain function and help your brain work more rapidly,
         <p>which in turn will help you stay focused and retain more information.
         <p>Drinking water will also help you stay refreshed and awake during your study sessions.</p>

     <li><b> Create a system for taking notes</b>
     <p>organize all of your notes in the same way. Not only does it make the information you’re looking for easier to find, but
         <p>it gives your brain a pattern to follow and a quick way to retrieve information.
         <p>So set a system of colors, indents, tabs, bullet points–whatever works for you–and organize your notes.</p>

     <li><b> Reward yourself for a solid study session</b>
     <p>Sometimes finishing a study session can feel like you’ve just finished running a marathon.
         <p>It’s exhausting, and it can take hours. But if you’ve just finished a solid study session, reward yourself for your hard work!</p>

     <li><b> Organize your study session before you start</b>
     <p> Starting a study session can feel like you’re standing at the bottom of Mount Everest. So do what the sherpas do, and make a plan.
         <p>Start by setting small, reachable (but challenging) goals for yourself and then organize them into a schedule.
         <p>If you give yourself a schedule to follow, you only have to tackle the first part of that schedule rather than the whole thing.</p>
