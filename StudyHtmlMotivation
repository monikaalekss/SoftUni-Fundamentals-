  <li>
    Write a list of the 3 main reasons you decided to study this course and stick it on your wall
  </li>
      <li>
        Write a list of your values and remind yourself of them regularly
      </li>
      <li>
        Imagine your life in the future and how your degree will help you
      </li>
</ul>

    <b>Set goals that motivate you</b>
    <p>Starting before you feel motivated is easier said than done, but

    <p>One trick is to break down big tasks into tiny steps.
    <p> Taking one step at a time can help us focus and feel less overwhelmed.</p>
